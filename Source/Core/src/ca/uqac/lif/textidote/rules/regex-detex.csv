# Spaces and punctuation

sh:d:002	\.[A-Za-z]		\.e		There should be a space after a period. If you are writing a URL or a filename, use the \url{} or \verb markup.
sh:d:003	\s\.[^\s]				There should not be a space before the period at the end of a sentence.
sh:d:004	\s,[^\s]				There should not be a space before a comma.
sh:d:005	\s[;:\?!]				There should not be a space before a punctuation mark. If in your language, typographic rules require a space here, LaTeX takes care of inserting it without your intervention.
sh:d:007	<<|>>					Use \og{} and \fg{} instead of << and >>.
sh:d:008	"						Use `` and '' instead of "".
#sh:d:009	\.\s+[a-z0-9]			A sentence should start with a capital letter.
