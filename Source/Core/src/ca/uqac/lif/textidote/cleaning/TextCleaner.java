 * Removes markup from a text file. A text cleaner can perform two kinds
 * of "cleanup" on a text file:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A full cleanup that removes all markup. Portions of the file that do
 * not contain meaningful text (for example, LaTeX equations) may also be
 * removed. As a rule, do not consider the output string as a completely
 * faithful clear-text rendition of the original document.</li>
 * <li>A cleanup that only removes blocks of text identified as comments.
 * What a "comment" means depends on the markup language, and some languages
 * may not have comments at all.</li>
