\section{a first section}

Here,I forget to put a space after a comma. I refer to \ref{fig:thisfig1} in the text, but I do not refer to the second one. \\
I can mention a filename such as \verb+myfile.txt+; some rules don't apply to this special markup; however, if I write myfile.txt, I'm likely to get a warning about a period not followed by a space.

\begin{equation*}
4.3 \times 8.4 = foo a.b
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hello % This is a comment
\item   World
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ My subsection. }

Some other text, part of which is <<special>>, very "special", like $4 \times 5 = 21$.
